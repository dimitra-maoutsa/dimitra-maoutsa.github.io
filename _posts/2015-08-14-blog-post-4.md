This is a random warning FYI:

Those low in originality and creativity and high in competitiveness and manipulative behaviour often seek to acquire ideas indirectly, by cultivating dependent relationships and strategic placement of **compliant former mentees** within laboratories likely to generate valuable research directions. **This allows them to gain early access to emerging ideas through controlled social channels, enabling them to monitor and extract promising research directions before they become public, and appropriate them as their own.** Systematic behaviour is, predictably, systematic. :)
