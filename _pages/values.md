### I believe deeply in collaboration, mutual uplift, and generosity.

### I have  no respect  for those who approach life with a scarcity mindset, who sabotage competition, or worse, abuse positions of power to undermine, exploit, and silence[^1] those they are meant to support.

Unfortunately, over the past years, I’ve learned that integrity isn’t always welcomed, but it’s the only way I know to move forward.

### I am in general VERY resistant to intimidation or any form of power flexing. Anyone who wants to influence my judgement and my perspective should only try to reason. Everything else just backfires. Speaking from experience. ;)

[^1]: You may get some hint by going here [https://clearsky.app/dimma.bsky.social/blocking](https://clearsky.app/dimma.bsky.social/blocking) and scrolling all the way down. Then try looking at past Bernstein conferences and workshops ~2015.
