### I believe deeply in collaboration, mutual uplift, and generosity.

### I have  no respect  for those who approach life with a scarcity mindset, who sabotage competition, or worse, abuse positions of power to undermine, exploit, and silence[^1] those they are meant to support.

Unfortunately, over the past years, I’ve learned that integrity isn’t always welcomed, but it’s the only way I know to move forward.

To my greatest surprise, I’ve found that those who act with the least integrity are often the loudest, not hiding in fear of exposure, but trying to intimidate and retaliate against those who stand in truth. That’s something I’ll never fully understand.
