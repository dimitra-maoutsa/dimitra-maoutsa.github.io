I am a postdoctoral researcher currently working on **Theoretical and Computational neuroscience** with a background on **stochastic dynamics, stochastic analysis, and nonlinear dynamics**.

I am broadly interested in **how learning and synaptic plasticity shape collective population dynamics and representational geometries, and how these changes manifest in behaviour.** 
Current projects involve:
 - devising a reinforcement learning based method for discovering plasticity rules for reinforcement training of RNNs [[see more](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/portfolio/portfolio--1/)]
 -  modelling the contextual reconfiguration of representations through top-down feedback [[see more](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-0b/)].

For further directions, please feel free to reach out.

I completed my PhD with **summa cum laude**[^2] under the mentorship of **Prof. Manfred Opper** in **March 2023** at the **Technical University of Berlin** ([degree: dated 13.04.2023](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F8WyFhBwLBV1ldzCnkQu4siwXaX0L-P_/view?usp=sharing) - [published online thesis at TUB library since 2023](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/items/19509be7-75b6-4774-a66c-bcc4c75fed8f))[^1] and under close colaboration with the **Institute of Mathematics at the University of Potsdam**. There by drawing insights from machine learning, statistical learning theory and statistical physics, we developed three frameworks for efficient **sampling, control, and inference of overdamped Langevin dynamics** ( [Maoutsa, Reich, Opper; Entropy; 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/8/802), [Maoutsa, Opper; MLPS-NeurIPS; 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13020), [Maoutsa, Opper; PRRev; 2022](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.043035), [Maoutsa; MLPS-NeurIPS; 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08102), [Maoutsa; Physics4ML-ICLR; 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00423) ).

The main contributions of my thesis ([thesis reviews](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/files/Gutachten_Maoutsa.pdf)) were an **interacting particle system** with deterministic dynamics for samling solutions of Fokker-Planck equations (now known as **probability flow ODEs**) (see [ODEs for SDEs](https://gitlab.com/dimitra-maoutsa/odes_for_sdes/-/blob/master/README.md)), a **feedback control** algorithm for stochastic dynamics (see [the paper](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.043035)), and a **stochastic control-inspired framework** for introducing **geometric inductive biases** into the dynamical inference of stochastic systems (see [from geometry to dynamics](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-5/)).

Before my PhD, I worked in the **Network Dynamics** (Timme) group at the **Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organisation** in Göttingen, after and during my master's on Computational Neuroscience at the University of Göttingen. During my stay there, I developed a method for identifying **synaptic interactions** from neuronal firing patterns based **on a geometric approximation of the inter-spike interval generating function** of each observed neuron ([Casadiego\*, Maoutsa\*, Timme; PRL; 2018](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.054101)[)](https://www.ds.mpg.de/publication-search/148862?person=%2Fpersons%2Fresource%2Fpersons238426)[,](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016APS..MARY12004T/abstract) and further studied phase transitions of autonomous intersections[.](https://pure.mpg.de/cone/persons/resource/persons238426?lang=de)

I made a short stint of ~1 year (July 2023 - Sept. 2024)[^3] as a postdoc at the **Computation in Neural Circuits** lab within the **School of Life Sciences** at Technical University of Munich working on topics relating **structure and function of neural circuits**. During that time I worked on identifying potential circuit mechanisms and design constraints that explain the differential representation of familiar and novel stimuli in layer 2/3 mouse V1 [[see more](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/)], and (co-)supervised **three Master’s students** working on: 

 - identifying **biologically plausible plasticity rules** for learning tasks with **low-dimensional representations** in the neuronal activity space [[see more](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/)], [ important to read ](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/M-Dims-Blog/posts/Three_factor_rules.html)

 - investigating **functional properties** of different **spike-timing dependent plasticity rules** on nonlinear Hawkes networks [see poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitra-maoutsa/dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/refs/heads/master/images/mini_poster.png)[[former worldwideneuro link seems broken](https://www.world-wide.org/bernstein-24/plasticity-driven-circuit-self-organization-afecdc22/)],  

 - revealing **structural and functional properties** of brain circuits from their **responses to optogenetic stimulation** [[see more](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/mentor/)].

Please prefer to not use my **tum.de** e-mail to contact me. I have lifetime forwarding since the account seems to remain alive forever, but cannot answer through this, and do not want my e-mails to go through the TUM server.

[^1]: Provided here to fend off creative fiction, in case some well-meaning person happens to claim that I don’t have a PhD...😘 In fact, you can even browse the [thesis reviews](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/files/Gutachten_Maoutsa.pdf), or read the actual published(!) document [online](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/items/19509be7-75b6-4774-a66c-bcc4c75fed8f) and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20251023174914/https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/items/19509be7-75b6-4774-a66c-bcc4c75fed8f). And since someone has been seeding doubts about whether I actually have all my degrees, here is my [diploma thesis](https://dspace.lib.ntua.gr/xmlui/handle/123456789/8730?locale-attribute=en) ( Here is the wayback archived version [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20251011171602/https://dspace.lib.ntua.gr/xmlui/handle/123456789/8730?locale-attribute=en) ).  Unfortunatelly my M.Sc. thesis seems to have been embargoed forever (was supposed to be embargoed for a year until we publish our paper), but I was about to start a [PhD with the same advisors in the same university](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5_VFxd24YDj9azy8-SYhWurGlEVQZ2S/view?pli=1) before my main advisor moved universities, so I think that this strongly suggests that I might have that one too.

[^3]: I outline a small subset of the reasons for such a short post-doc in my [Blog](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/M-Dims-Blog/), while you can also find a hint in [Other](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/other/) and in [Values](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/values/) too, however to understand the latter you need to either know me personally and ask me if you need clarification of what has happened. **The main reason is that beyond insufficient support, the environment became adversarial in ways that tried to undermine my previous achievements and professional standing and aimed to damage my credibility and reputation. This seemed and seems ungrounded unless one is aware of background dynamics and the persons involved.** For more details contact me in person.
