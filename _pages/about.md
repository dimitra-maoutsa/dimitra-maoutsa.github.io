Hi, you just landed on my under construction personal website! 


Briefly, I am a postdoctoral researcher currently working on **Theoretical and Computational neuroscience** with a background on **stochastic dynamics, stochastic analysis, and nonlinear dynamics**.

If you want to know more, you can either **be patient** :skull: and visit this page in a few days, or visit my older (unupdatable) website here: [https://dimitra-maoutsa.gitlab.io/](https://dimitra-maoutsa.gitlab.io/) . (However keep in mind that it has not been updated after I finished my PhD and I no longer have access to it. )
