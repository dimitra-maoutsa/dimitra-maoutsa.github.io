[Under construction website]
======
Hi, you just landed on my under-construction personal website. You can either **be patient** and visit this page in a few days or visit my older (now depracated) website here: [https://dimitra-maoutsa.gitlab.io/](https://dimitra-maoutsa.gitlab.io/) . (However keep in mind that the older website does not contain projects and teaching experience pursued during my postdoctoral role and I have lost access to it.)
