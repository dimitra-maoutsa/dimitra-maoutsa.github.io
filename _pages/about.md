I am a postdoctoral researcher currently working on **Theoretical and Computational neuroscience** with a background on **stochastic dynamics, stochastic analysis, and nonlinear dynamics**.

I completed my PhD under the mentorship of **Prof. Manfred Opper** in **March 2023** at the Technical University of Berlin ([degree](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F8WyFhBwLBV1ldzCnkQu4siwXaX0L-P_/view?usp=sharing))[^1] and under close colaboration with the Institute of Mathematics at the University of Potsdam. There by drawing insights from machine learning, statistical learning theory and statistical physics, we developed three frameworks for efficient **sampling, control, and inference of overdamped Langevin dynamics** ( [Maoutsa, Reich, Opper; Entropy; 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/8/802), [Maoutsa, Opper; MLPS-NeurIPS; 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13020), [Maoutsa, Opper; PRRev; 2022](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.043035), [Maoutsa; MLPS-NeurIPS; 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08102), [Maoutsa; Physics4ML-ICLR; 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00423) ).\
The main contributions of my thesis ([thesis reviews](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/files/Gutachten_Maoutsa.pdf)) were an **interacting particle system** with deterministic dynamics for samling solutions of Fokker-Planck equations, a **feedback control** algorithm for stochastic dynamics, and a **feedback control-inspired framework** for introducing **geometric inductive biases** into the dynamical inference of stochastic systems.

Before my PhD, I worked in the **Network Dynamics** (Timme) group at the **Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organisation** in GÃ¶ttingen, after and during my master's on Computational Neuroscience at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. During my stay there, I developed a method for identifying synaptic interactions from spike trains by proposing a mapping of the spiking activity to high-dimensional event spaces that effectively reveal the underlying neuronal interactions ([Casadiego\*, Maoutsa\*, Timme; PRL; 2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QAjTnnOx4pykA_7WAnuApRMgdmWtGrIR/view))[,](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016APS..MARY12004T/abstract) and further studied phase transitions of autonomous intersections[.](https://pure.mpg.de/cone/persons/resource/persons238426?lang=de)

I made a short stint of ~1 year (July 2023 - Sept. 2024) at the **Computation in Neural Circuits** lab within the **School of Life Sciences** at Technical University of Munich working on topics relating **structure and function of neural circuits**. During that time I worked on identifying potential circuit mechanisms and design constraints that explain the differential representation of familiar and novel stimuli in layer 2/3 mouse V1, and (co-)supervised **three Masterâ€™s students** working on: 

 - identifying **biologically plausible plasticity rules** for learning tasks with **low-dimensional representations** in the neuronal activity space, 

 - investigating **functional properties** of different **spike-timing dependent plasticity rules** on nonlinear Hawkes networks,  

 - revealing **structural and functional properties** of brain circuits from their **responses to optogenetic stimulation**.
