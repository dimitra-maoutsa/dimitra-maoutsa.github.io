- **Muhammed Gorunnen**: **internship student** at the Elite Master of Science in Neuroengineering program worked on revealing **functional and structural properties of brain circuits** from their **responses to optogenetic perturbations**, reconciling experimental
observations collected from mouse Layer 2/3 in V1. Here is my project description: [online doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTI2byp9fnnuiosfPm0uNUoZ5ktqxUwVty-m0DkNqHk1dMM5oqWXcRevCsOTA9DtG6sVDuRka1J2IqG/pub)
and here is his [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/111LEU1VtoUKUwI3WLtEabE1KkoBI4d5y/view?usp=share_link). \
**[completed: Aug. 2023 - Nov. 2023]**


- **Pablo Crespo**: **Master’s thesis student** enrolled in the Biomedical Computing program at the Technical University of Munich. Co-
supervised with Dr. Matt Getz, Pablo focuses on formulating **biologically plausible plasticity rules** for learning cognitive tasks with
low-dimensional representations in the neural space. Here is one of the posters Pablo presented [Bernstein Conference 2024](https://www.world-wide.org/bernstein-24/shaping-low-rank-recurrent-neural-9e3c69df/). \
 **[completed: Oct. 2023 - Aug. 2024]**


- **Raul Adell Segarra**: **Master’s thesis student** ( Erasmus exchange student from the Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering program of the Technical University of Catalonia, Spain ). Co-supervised with Dr. Dylan Festa, Raul explored the **dynamics
of spike timing-dependent plasticity on spiking stabilised supralinear networks** (Nonlinear Hawkes Networks) through both numerical simulations and analytical calculations. Here is one of the posters Raul presented [Bernstein Conference 2024](https://www.world-wide.org/bernstein-24/plasticity-driven-circuit-self-organization-afecdc22/), and here is his [thesis](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/408858). \
 **[completed: Sep. 2023 - May 2024]** 

- **Introduction to Computational Neuroscience group projects**: Solely directed and mentored **6 groups** (2-3 students each) in executing practical research projects that served as their final evaluation for the lecture Introduction to Computational Neuroscience. More details [here](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/teaching/2023-spring-teaching-2) . \
 **[completed: Nov. 2023 - Mar 2024]**

- **Neuromatch Academy Computational Neuroscience summer school**: Mentored two groups on their research projects on **a PFC-Motor RNN** project (group Manifold Mechanics) and on **inter-area communications** using the IBL dataset (group 404). \
 **[completed: July 2025]**


- **Neuromatch Academy NeuroAI summer school**: Mentored four groups on their research projects. Two groups working on **biologically informed network architectures** for robotic control, and two on **biologically plaussible learning algorithms**. \
 **[completed: July 2025]**

- **Sahar Hoseinzade, Mohammad Jalili**: Modelling and data analysis project on the influence of **attention and reward** on the emer-
gence of prediction errors in V1 based on the Allen Institute Calcium imaging behaviour dataset.\
**[Oct. 2024 - Apr. 2025]**
