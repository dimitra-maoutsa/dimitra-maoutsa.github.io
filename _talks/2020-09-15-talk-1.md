Twenty minutes talk at the CRC 1294 virtual event organised by the Institute of Mathematics at the University of Potsdam. 

Presented the interacting particle systems framework for simulating solutions of Fokker-Planck equations and the score-function estimator necessary for that framework ( [Maoutsa, Reich, Opper; Entropy; 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/8/802)).
