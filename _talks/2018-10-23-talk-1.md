One hour long talk at the Workshop **Stochastic dynamicson large networks: Prediction and inference**

Presented my pre-PhD work during my research stay at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organisation on inference of synaptic interactions from spike trains ([Casadiego\*, Maoutsa\*, Timme; PRL; 2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QAjTnnOx4pykA_7WAnuApRMgdmWtGrIR/view)).

Invited by Peter Sollich, Manfred Opper, Guido Sanguinetti.
