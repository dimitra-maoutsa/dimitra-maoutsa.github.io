Fourty-five minutes seminar talk at the Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation, University of Edinburgh.

Presented my PhD work on sampling, control, and inference of stochastic dynamics, leading to framework for inference of latent low-dimensional dynamics from neural population responses.

Invited by Angus Chadwick.

This was a job interview for a postdoctoral position for which I received an offer ( [see here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E95DSdLjB0j2_6GDDm09zS5ffs-AvHui/view?usp=share_link) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NVQZBCpFEgxbbxEklfhY1DKX4ZDw_vxg/view?usp=share_link) [^2] ), which I declined solely for personal reasons unrelated to the research group or potential collaborators. **My decision not to accept this offer was later used by others[^1] to obstruct opportunities that were a better fit for my personal circumstances.**


[^1]: who were already looking for ways to obstruct me for reasons that were neither transparent nor professionally justifiable but rather personal
[^2]: The deadline (10th of June) for my response was not incidental. [ neuro lecture calendar ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tQCyfB4CjytIPXTlGtbtp4go-Nsmxgkz/view?usp=share_link) At that day the person who was orchestrating my obstruction would have to engage a different strategy if I didn't accept this position. Incidentally, although until that point, we had arranged that I will attend the MCN summer school only if I could pay for all the expenses out of my pocket (with the hope that I wouldn't be able to cover the expenses and wouldn't go), on 11th of June my former advisor announced that they would pay for the flight tickets, so as to ensure that I will be able to attend. If only we knew what changed and what was aranged on 10th of June... ;)
