Fourty-five minutes seminar talk at the Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation, University of Edinburgh.

Presented my PhD work on sampling, control, and inference of stochastic dynamics, leading to framework for inference of latent low-dimensional dynamics from neural population responses.

Invited by Angus Chadwick.

This was a job interview for a postdoctoral position for which I received an offer ( [see here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E95DSdLjB0j2_6GDDm09zS5ffs-AvHui/view?usp=share_link) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NVQZBCpFEgxbbxEklfhY1DKX4ZDw_vxg/view?usp=share_link) ), which I declined solely for personal reasons unrelated to the research group or potential collaborators. **My decision not to accept this offer was later used by others[^1] to obstruct opportunities that were a better fit for my personal circumstances.**
