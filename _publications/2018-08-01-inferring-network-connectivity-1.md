We introduced a mapping of the network spiking activity to high-dimensional spaces, called **event spaces**, spanned by the relative spiking intervals of all neurons in the network. This mapping can be construed as a sampling of the inter-spike interval generating function for each neuron. To identify the effect of putative pre-synaptic neurons to a post-synaptic one we proposed a linearisation of the inter-spike interval generating function around a reference point (reference event).
