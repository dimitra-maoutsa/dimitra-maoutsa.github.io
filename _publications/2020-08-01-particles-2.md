We introduced an interacting particle system with purely deterministic dynamics that provides accurate Fokker--Planck solutions for diffusive systems. The formulation relies on a variational representation of the logarithmic gradient of the instaneous Fokker-Planck probability density. Our approach does not require the knowledge (or even the existence) of a steady state, and is thereby relevant even for systems with time inhomogeneous dynamics.
