title: "Multiple adaptation mechanisms account for the emergence of prediction error responses in V1"
excerpt: "We identify possible plasticity mechanisms that explain the adaptation of responses to repeated stimulus presentations and the emergence of prediction error responses in a recurrent circuit model with multiple interneuron sub-types. <br/><img src='/images/linear_response_small2.png'>"

We employ linear response theory to identify design constraints and adaptation mechanisms that explain the differential responses of different interneuron sub-types to contextual and familiarity expectation violations.
