title: "Multiple adaptation mechanisms account for the emergence of prediction error responses in V1"
excerpt: "We identify possible plasticity mechanisms that explain the adaptation of responses to repeated stimulus presentations and the emergence of prediction error responses in a recurrent circuit model with multiple interneuron sub-types <br/> started during PostDoc at TUM <br/><img src='/images/linear_response_small2.png' alt='Schematic of mean-field and multi-neuron circuit-Dimitra Maoutsa'>"

We employ linear response theory to identify design constraints and adaptation mechanisms that explain the differential responses of different interneuron sub-types to contextual and familiarity expectation violations.

Here is a presentation with an overview I gave on September 2024 (my last day at TU Munich). Current version of the project and receent presentation given at Flatiron differs considerably. [slides](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitra-maoutsa/dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/refs/heads/master/files/GroupMeeting-September2024.pdf) \
More presentations with preliminary results are in this folder: [presentation folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11nz5tIG8dr1M-euhQFMTWB8lvQkJpX1w) , and some more dispersed simulation results are in the [simulations folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ebkQKcl-VniDqrhsg81e1hgouh7Ncs3h) .

Presented as an **oral presentation** at: **Junior theoretical Neuroscience workshop - Flatiron Institute - July 2025** (first part of the presentation)

Presented as a **poster presentation** at: 

- **Bernstein Conference - Sept. 2024**
- **Munich BCCN retreat - July 2024**
- **Munich Brain day - April 2024**
