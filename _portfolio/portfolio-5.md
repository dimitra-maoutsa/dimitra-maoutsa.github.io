We introduced a method for introducing **geometric inductive biases** into the inference of stochastic systems. \
The central idea is to **view the deterministic flow field as a scaffold upon which system states fluctuate**,
and to approximate this scaffold in terms of **distortions of a metric induced by the observations**. \
This effectivelly approximates the low-dimensional invariant density without the need to project to a lower dimensional space (whose dimensionality would be hard to
estimate due to the presence of fluctuations). 

**This is the last part of my PhD thesis and the first single author paper I wrote.**
