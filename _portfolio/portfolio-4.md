This is an extention of my previous work [From geometry to dynamics](https://dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-5/) on neural data inspired by the work of [Genkin, M., Hughes, O., & Engel, T. A. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26202-1). This essentially reformulates the problem of inference latent stochastic dynamics from a stochastic control perspective.
