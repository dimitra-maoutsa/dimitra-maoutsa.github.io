We study how different plasticity rules affect the low-dimensional representations and dynamics of low-rank recurrent neural networks,
 and employ simulation based inference within a teacher-student framework to identify plasticity rules that solve common neuroscience tasks. 
The low-dimensional representions of gradient-descent trained teacher networks serve as activity characterisers 
for infering biologically-plausible plasticity rules that imprint these low-dimensional representations onto the student networks. 


You can see the poster that Pablo presented at Bernstein conference 2024: [poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitra-maoutsa/dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/refs/heads/master/images/Shaping%20Low-Rank%20Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks%20with%20Biological%20Learning%20Rules%20Bernstein.png) [^2] .

And here is the presentation we gave at a group retreat on April 2024 altogether here: [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oDrFxc2aCzDteNMSVGniCC7XufMFvoZB/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=118137270217997530927&rtpof=true&sd=true) [^1]. 

Here is the cover of Pablo's thesis [cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitra-maoutsa/dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/refs/heads/master/images/Pablo_cover.png), (please contact me or Pablo directly if you would like to read it), and in case someone claims otherwise, here is the history of the overleaf file [history screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitra-maoutsa/dimitra-maoutsa.github.io/refs/heads/master/images/history_Pablo_thesis.png).
