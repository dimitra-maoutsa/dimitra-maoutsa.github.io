We study how different plasticity rules affect the low-dimensional representations and dynamics of low-rank recurrent neural networks,
 and employ simulation based inference within a teacher-student framework to identify plasticity rules that solve common neuroscience tasks. 
The low-dimensional representions of gradient-descent trained teacher networks serve as activity characterisers 
for infering biologically-plausible plasticity rules that imprint these low-dimensional representations onto the student networks.
