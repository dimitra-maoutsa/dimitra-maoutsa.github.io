We proposed a **mapping of the spiking activity to high-dimensional spaces**, termed **event spaces**, spanned by the inter-spike intervals of a selected neuron and the respective cross-spike intervals of the rest of the network. The mapping from the raster plot to the event spaces may be viewed as a sampling of the inter-spike interval generating function for each neuron. To **identify the effect of putative pre-synaptic neurons** to a post-synaptic one we proposed a **geometric approximation** of the inter-spike interval generating function around a reference point (reference event).
To **identify the transmission delays**, we proposed the minimisation of the approximation error in the space of interaction delays. To speed up the optimisation and avoid local minima, we optimised the delays on a smoothed error landscape approximated by radial basis function interpolation.
