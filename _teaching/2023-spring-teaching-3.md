Tutorials focusing on practical implementation in Python of concepts covered during the lecture **Introduction to Computational Neuroscience**.
Topics included neural coding, rate neuronal models, spike-timing and rate-based plasticity, dimensionality reduction, and reinforcement learning.

Presented 8 out of 13 (1.5h/week) tutorials
